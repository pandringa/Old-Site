#Andrin.ga

Source for my website (http://andrin.ga). It was previously hosted on my personal Node.js server, but I stripped it down to static HTML, and now host it on GitHub pages.

##Main file structure: 

**index.html**: Main homepage

**all.min.css**: CSS libraries, compiled using yuicompressor.jar (from the CLI)

**screen.css**: Main CSS file, compiled from the sass in sass/screen.scss

**all.min.js**: JS libraries, compiled using yuicompressor.jar (from the CLI)

**home.js**: Main JS file, powering the homepage.
