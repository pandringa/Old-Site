<p><span class="greet">Hello!</span> My name is Peter Andringa, and I'm currently a high school student at <a href="http://tjhsst.edu">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, an elite high school in Northern Virginia specifically for students who love math, science, engineering, and computer science. I'm currently in my Sophomore year, and even though its a lot of work I really enjoy studying there.</p>
<p>Over the last couple years I've developed a passion for entrepreneurship, product design, and making my ideas come to life through code. Outside of school I spend much of my time devoted to these things, whether it be through internships, helping lead my school's entrepreneurship club, organizing <a href="http://tjhackathon.com">HackTJ</a> and <a href="http://gopilot.org">Pilot</a> events, or even just tinkering on some of my own <a href="/projects">projects</a>. I love building cools and teaching others how to do so, because I think there's nothing cooler than seeing your idea come to life.</p>
<p>I'm always open to new opportunities or ideas, so don't hesitate to get in contact with me via email (<a href="mailto:peter@andrin.ga">peter@andrin.ga</a>), because I'd love to hear from you!</p>
